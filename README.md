Summary of methodologies
- Collecting data from public SpaceX API and SpaceX Wikipedia Page. 
- Converting mission outcomes into Training Labels with `1` means the booster successfully landed `0` means it was unsuccessful during data wrangling.
- Performing some Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to find some patterns in data using SQL and Data Visualization.
- Performing more interactive visual analytics using Folium and creating dashboard.
- Preprocessing data to create dummy variables to categorical columns, standardize the data in X, and splitting data
- Using GridSearchCV to find best parameters for machine learning models.

Summary of all results
- Four machine learning models were produced: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree Classifier, and K Nearest Neighbors. 
- All produced similar results with accuracy rate about 83.33%.
